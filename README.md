# Robot Foundation Models

A visual tracker for the evolution of robot foundation models, from LLM planners to VLAs to the emerging VAM paradigm.

Note that there is often incomplete or partial data available and real-world deployments almost never match lab-controlled experiments and results. Therefore this dashboard shouldn't be viewed as a canonical source of truth or a formalized literature review, rather it is a high-level snapshot of meaningful contributions that attempts to help viewers build an intuition of research trends and developments.
